# gopherjs-net-http

gopherjs-net-http is a light weight implementation of the more useful parts of net/http in the way they're often used in the browser using GopherJS.
It avoids the huge amount of imports that comes with importing net/http directly.

It is based on the Go 1.5 net/http package and on github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/compiler/natives/net/http
